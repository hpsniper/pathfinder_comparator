pathfinder_comparator
=====================

A collection of php scripts to build and compare Pathfinder Builds.

How To Use
----------

Currently php being installed and calling:
`$php runner.php`
is all that is required.
An output html file is placed in `www/compare.html` which can be viewed in any browser

The classes being compared are currently hardcoded in `builder.php`

`classes.php` hold all of the information about each class. For this tool to be feature complete, this file has to be fleshed out with all classes information.
